        "This notebook implements a **hybrid deep learning model** combining **CNN** and **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)** layers for stock price forecasting. The model integrates both local pattern extraction and long-term dependencies from financial time series. A **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** algorithm is applied **post-training** to optimally combine the outputs of CNN and LSTM components.\n",
